<h1>JQL Documentation</h1>

<b>Joonas Query Language</b>, or <b>JQL</b> for short, is a very straightforward database query language to use if you are familiar with SQL.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>JQL</b> is a language that I devised.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>JQL</b> is basically identical to SQL in terms of functionality. The syntax in my language is just different.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<b>SQL</b> has commands such as:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE</p>
<br/>
My <b>JQL</b> language has commands which are equivalent to those commands, but in JQL, the respective commands are:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>GET, ADD, CHANGE, REMOVE, NEW TABLE.</p>

<h2 id="viewing_rows_of_table">Viewing the Rows of the Table</h2>

The <span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>GET</span> command is used for retrieving rows from one or several tables.
<br/>
The JQL equivalent for SQL "*" (all columns) is the <b>ALL</b> keyword. Eg. the JQL equivalent for SQL "SELECT * FROM tablename" is:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>GET ALL tablename</p>

To retrieve specific columns from the table - for example column1, column2, column3 - simply specify the column names the same way as in SQL:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>GET column1, column2, column3 tablename</p>

<h2 id="viewing_names_of_all_tables">Viewing the Names of All the Tables in the Database</h2>
To see what tables exist in the database, simply execute the GET command without any parameters:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>GET</p>

<h2 id="inserting_row_to_table">Inserting a Row to the Table</h2>

The <span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>ADD</span> command is used for adding a new row to a table.
<br/>
Example for a table named "products" which has columns "id", "name", "date", "qty":
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>ADD products (1, "product1", "2026-03-01", 500)</p>
To add several rows in one query, separate each row with a comma (you might also want to add a line break between each line for better readability but that is not mandatory):
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>
ADD products (1, "product1", "2026-03-01", 500),
<br/>
(2, "product2", "2026-03-02", 250)
</p>

<h2 id="modifying_row_of_table">Modifying a Row of the Table</h2>

The <span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>CHANGE</span> command is used for changing one or several rows of a table.
<br/>
<p class="warning">
Care should be taken when using this command if the intention is to modify only one of the rows of the table.
<br/>
You might want to ensure that you only target the desired row(s) by using a GET query first.
</p>
Your table most likely has a unique identifier for each row of the table. "id" for example, which is usually an integer value that automatically increments by one every time a new row is added to the table.
<br/>
To change a specific row, for example a row with id of value 2, use:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>
CHANGE products (name "Mouse", qty 300) IF id = 2
</p>
The above query changes the "name" column of the requested row ("id" = 2) to "Mouse" and the "qty" column to 300.
<br/>
If you wish to modify all the rows of your table, for example you wish to name all products "Mouse" and their quantities to 300, just omit the IF condition:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>
CHANGE products (name "Mouse", qty 300)
</p>
<span class="warning">Obviously, great care should be taken when executing a command that modifies all records.</span>

<h2 id="deleting_row_from_table">Deleting a Row from the Table</h2>

The <span style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>REMOVE</span> command is used for removing one or several rows from a table.
<br/>
<p class="warning">
Care should be taken when using this command if the intention is to remove only one of the rows of the table.
<br/>
You might want to ensure that you only target the desired row(s) by using a GET query first.
</p>
To remove the row from the table which has "id" of value 2, use the following query:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>
REMOVE products IF id = 2
</p>
If you wish to delete all the rows of your table but you wish to keep the table itself (so that your table is empty but ready to receive new records), just omit the IF condition:
<p style='font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;'>
REMOVE products
</p>
<span class="warning">Obviously, great care should be taken when executing a command that deletes all records.</span>
